### create-zachmcm-app
A CLI for generating the boilerplate for an Express.js server using Typescript. Basically, I got tired of taking 3 hours to set up a Typescript Express.js server, so I took matters into my own hands.

### Installation
```
npm i -g create-zachmcm-app
```

### Usage
```
npx create-zachmcm-app
```
